## ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess AI Bot with Real-Time Multiplayer (Research-Oriented )

A research-driven Python-based Chess AI leveraging **NegaMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**, custom **state management**, and **real-time multiplayer gameplay** powered by **Socket.IO** and **Redis Pub/Sub**. Designed for scalability, performance, and extensibility, this system forms the backbone of a modern chess engine with real-time interaction and AI intelligence.

## Overview

This project is an advanced chess platform built with a focus on:

* **Algorithmic Intelligence** via game-tree search and pruning
* **Scalable Communication** via event-driven architecture
* **Efficient State Handling** using custom serialization and move tracking

The goal is not just to build a working chess app, but to explore **AI design patterns**, **real-time distributed systems**, and **domain-specific decision modeling**.

## Architecture

```txt
Client (React) <-- Socket.IO --> Flask Backend
                                    |
                             Redis Pub/Sub
                                    |
                        GameState & AI Logic (Python)
```

* **Socket.IO** enables low-latency real-time messaging.
* **Redis** acts as a message broker for multiplayer session coordination.
* **GameState** handles move validation, turn tracking, and board rendering.

## AI Design (NegaMax + Alpha-Beta)

The core of the AI lies in a **recursive NegaMax search tree** with:

* **Position Evaluation** function using material balance and positional weights
* **Depth-limited Search** with configurable difficulty levels
* **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for optimized search space

```python
def negaMax(board, depth, alpha, beta, isMaximizing):
    if depth == 0 or game_over(board):
        return evaluate(board)
    for move in generate_moves(board):
        apply(move)
        score = -negaMax(new_board, depth-1, -beta, -alpha, not isMaximizing)
        undo(move)
        alpha = max(alpha, score)
        if alpha >= beta:
            break
    return alpha
```

---

## Multiplayer Infrastructure

* **Socket.IO (Server-side)** listens for events like `move`, `join`, `resign`
* **Redis Pub/Sub** enables real-time session updates across multiple server instances
* **Room Management**: Each game is encapsulated in a socket room, backed by Redis topic

---

## State Management

* **GameState Class** encapsulates board, player turns, history, and check/checkmate detection
* **Move Class** abstracts movement, captures, promotions, and notation
* **Stateless Frontend ‚Üí Smart Backend**: All game logic resides in backend for integrity

```python
game_state.makeMove(move)
valid_moves = game_state.getValidMoves()
```
